# artificial-intelligence-practices
5 projects to practice A*, UCS, CSP, Planning, Alpha-Beta Pruning and Bayesian Network.

## Projects
See the related project folders for more detailed descriptions.
### [Project 1: Solving Bloxorz Using A* and UCS](./p1_solving_bloxorz_using_a*_and_ucs)
Implemented [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and [UCS](https://www.educba.com/uniform-cost-search/) algorithms to solve the early stages of the Bloxorz Puzzle and make a performance comparison.
### [Project 2: Solving Aquarium Puzzle Using CSP](./p2_solving_aquarium_puzzle_using_csp)
Represented the Aquarium Puzzle as a [Constraint Satisfaction Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction) and solved it using the [constraint](https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/) library.
### [Project 3: Solving Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle Using Planning](./p3_solving_fox%2C_goose%2C_and_bag_of_beans_puzzle_using_planning)
Represented the [Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem) in [PDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language) format and solved it using the [Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org/HomePage) library.
### [Project 4: Alpha–Beta Pruning](./p4_game_tree_search)
Implementation of the [Alpha–beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning#:~:text=Alpha%E2%80%93beta%20pruning%20is%20a,%2C%20Go%2C%20etc.) algorithm to create a two-player zero-sum game that the player play against the AI.
### [Project 5: Bayesian Network](./p5_bayesian_network)
A [Bayesian Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) example in [Samiam](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/).
